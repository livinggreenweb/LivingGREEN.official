<h2><b>What Are Fossil-Fuels?</b></h2>
<br>
<p> Hydrocarbon-containg material, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, that are naturally formed in the Earth's crust from the remains of dead plants and animals, which are then extracted and burned as a fuel for energy. The burning of fossil-fuels can be used to provide direct heat, power engines, or to generate electricity.</p>
<br> 
<br>
<h2><b>Why Are They Harmful?</b></h2>
<br>
<p>The burning of fossil fuels has the potential to cause sever global warming. Not only that, pollutants that cause death, respiratory attacks and disorders, time out of school, work, etc. are all results of the increase in fossil fuel usage. These nonrenewable resources supply around 80% of the world's energy use, but by using our provided clean energy solutions, we, together, can reduce the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere.</p>
